## Installation instructions
**Supported operating systems:** Windows 7 or newer, Linux (x86 and ARM)

**System Specifications:** It is recommended to meet the 
[same requirements as *Minecraft: Java Edition*](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360035131371-Minecraft-Java-Edition-system-requirements-)
since the same underlying graphics library (GLFW) is used.

These instructions are the same if you're downloading the game for the first time or upgrading to a new version.

__Windows (64-bit only, no Java installation required):__
1. Navigate to the [latest release here](https://github.com/chrislo27/PolyrhythmMania/releases/latest) in a new tab or window.
2. Download the correct version of the game in the Assets section named `PolyrhythmMania_VERSION_win64.zip`, where VERSION is the release version name. **Note the "win64" in the file name.** Don't download the "Source code".
3. Find the downloaded zip file in File Explorer. Extract the zip file: right click the downloaded zip file, click "Extract All...", and extract the contents to a folder.
4. Open the newly extracted folder and go into the `PolyrhythmMania_win64` folder.
5. Double-click the `LaunchPolyrhythmMania.exe` executable to start the game! (You don't need the Java Runtime Environment already installed, the game comes with a copy.)
6. If Windows Defender says "Windows Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting", you can safely ignore it by clicking "More info" and then "Run anyway".

__Other platforms (or for advanced users who already have Java installed)__
1. **(Pre-requisite)** Ensure you already have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE 11 recommended, JRE 8 minimum) installed and it is accessible in your path as the `java` command. Starting with future version v1.1 and later, the minimum Java language version will be 11.
2. Navigate to the [latest release here](https://github.com/chrislo27/PolyrhythmMania/releases/latest) in a new tab or window.
3. Download the correct version of the game in the Assets section named `PolyrhythmMania_VERSION.zip`, where VERSION is the release version name. Don't download the "Source code".
4. Extract the zip file to a known location.
5. Open the newly extracted directory and go into the `PolyrhythmMania_platform_agnostic` directory.
6. Run the appropriate launch script: On Windows, double click `play_windows.bat`. On Linux, run the `play_linux.sh` file (you may have to `chmod +x play_linux.sh` first).
7. If you prefer not to use a launch script, you can run `java -jar bin/PolyrhythmMania.jar` with your preferred settings.
